## Description
This project demonstrates a typescript compilation issue that occurs  when compiling types generated by `apollo client:codegen` when the following are true:

- Typescript compiler is version 3.7 or above
- The named mutation matches the called mutation (see `UpdateBookMutation.ts`)

## Prerequisites

Apollo should be installed globally.

- `yarn global add apollo`

## Start local graphql server

- `cd server`
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

## Generate client types

- `cd client`
- `yarn`
- `yarn gql:gen`
- `yarn build`  <- this is where error occurs

The exact error message is:

```
error TS2440: Import declaration conflicts with local declaration of 'UpdateBook'.
```
